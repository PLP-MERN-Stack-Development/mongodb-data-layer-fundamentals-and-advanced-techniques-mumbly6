üìö PLP Bookstore ‚Äì MongoDB Project
üìñ Overview

This project sets up a MongoDB database for a bookstore application.
We implemented basic CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing using MongoDB.

The project consists of:

A script to insert sample book data into MongoDB (insert_books.js)

A file containing all MongoDB queries (queries.js)

Documentation (README.md) and a screenshot of MongoDB Compass/Atlas

 locally.

Option B: Use MongoDB Atlas
 (free cluster).

2. Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <your-repo-folder>
